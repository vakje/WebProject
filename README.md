# Simple Store Web Prototype

This is a prototype e-commerce web application built using **PHP**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It was created as part of my journey into full-stack development and simulates a basic store workflow without a database.



## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Data Storage**: Plain `.txt` files used to simulate persistence (user data, cart, etc.)

## How to Run Locally

 Clone the repository  
 Make sure you have a local PHP server (XAMPP)  
 Place project folder in `htdocs`  
 Start the server and go to `http://localhost/WebProject/mainpage.html`

##  Notes

This is a **learning prototype** and not production-ready. Built from scratch as a personal project to learn basic backend logic with php
